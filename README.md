 # Story
 
Welcome to Insomnia, the state of mind in which dreams become stagnant, and nightmares run rampant. But in this nightmarish void, nothing is as it seems. Labeled as insane and dismissed as hallucinations, you hear the shadows whispering truths. As the darkness deepens, the monsters in your mind awaken. Can you escape this haunting abyss, or will you be another lost soul in the endless night?
