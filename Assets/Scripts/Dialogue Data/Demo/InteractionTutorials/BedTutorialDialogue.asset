  - My very own bed! I have to press the "left shift" button in order to get in it.
  - While im in the bed I can still use my flashlight.
  - I turn it off whenever I sleep though, just to make sure I save the battery.
  - I can also hide under the bed by pressing the "Q" button.
  - You can never be too safe after all.
