  _dialogue:
  - (Welcome to the night time phase of the game! Strange things happen at night,
    so you gotta be careful.  I'm assuming you're new here, so I will explain how
    things work.)
  - (It's pretty dark in your room, so if you ever need to have light for something,
    or someone, just click the 'right mouse button' to toggle your flashlight.)
  - (Careful though, it runs out after a certain amount of time. Give it some time
    and it will be available again.)
  - '(Since this is only the first night, you will only have to focus on one enemy
    this time: The dummies!)'
  - (These dummies like to play pretend a lot so you gotta watch them carefully.
    The second you aren't looking then...)
  - (BAM! *EXPLOSION SOUNDS*)
  - (Nah, I'm just playing. They will kill you though, so yeah...)
  - (*Ahem*)
  - (.....)
  - (Anyways.... just... i don't know, shine a light on em?)
  - (If I were a dummy, which I'm not by the way
  - (Try to fall asleep, and shine the light on the dummies scare them away!)
