  - (Okay no problem! Allow me to explain.)
  - (On the left side of the screen is your flashlight battery meter.)
  - (It's pretty dark in your room, you know....)
  - (So if you ever need to have light for something, or someone, click the 'right
    mouse button' to toggle your flashlight.)
  - (Careful though, it runs out after a certain amount of time. Give it some time
    and it will be available again.)
  - (On the lower right side of the screen is your sleep meter. It will go up as
    you fall asleep.)
  - (In order to sleep, simply hold the 'spacebar' key.)
  - (Sleeping does leave you vulunerable to...unwanted guests though, so always keep
    an eye out!)
  - '(Since this is only the first night, you will only have to focus on one enemy
    this time: The dummies!)'
  - (These dummies like to play pretend a lot so you gotta watch them carefully.
    The second you aren't looking then...)
  - (BAM! *EXPLOSION SOUNDS*)
  - (Nah, I'm just playing. They will kill you though, so yeah...)
  - (*Ahem*)
  - (.....)
  - (Anyways.... just... i don't know, shine a light on em?)
  - (If I were a dummy, which I'm not by the way, I would run away. But that's just
    me.)
  - (But yeah just try to fall asleep while not getting killed by the dummies! Seems
    pretty simple, so I have no doubt that you got this!)
