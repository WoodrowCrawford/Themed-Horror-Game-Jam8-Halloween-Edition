  - Ugh... must have been another nightmare....
  - It's weird though. I've been having that strange dream a lot recently.
  - In it, I'm playing with toys, minding my own buisness, then the room starts to
    shake.
  - The floor starts to crack, and I try to run away. As I'm running, I suddenly
    fall into a hole.
  - And then I wake up. Creepy.
  - Anyways, I should probably get out of bed and look around some.
